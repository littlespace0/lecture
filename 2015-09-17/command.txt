ghost cells 

actual domain d
width of ghost k
extra cells: (d+2k)^2-d^2

The choose of width of ghost cell is to easy read and write

suppose 256*256 bit cache, if only 1 bit ghost
Then the real cells are 254*254, not multiplier of 64, hard to read and write
best way should be 32* width of ghost cells
